GirlieMac! WAP site is available at **http://m.girliemac.com** for all WAP 2.0 mobile devices (XHTML-MP), as well as HTML-capable devices such as iPhone

Most of decent cell phones in the US should be compatible, but if you have phones with no browser, or old WAP 1.0 handsets that can read only WML, sorry, you are out of luck&#8230; Also some Japan-made devices with browsers that interpret only their proprietary markups cannot display any standard WAP sites.

If your phone has a barcode scanner (such as Nokia N93), use the QR-Code on this blog (see the pink code on the right column) to go to GirlieMac! Mobile.

If you are an iPhone user, try my iPhone web app, iCureOverload (The award-winning CuteOverload optimized for iPhone, created by GirlieMac!). Go to m.girliemac.com to find the link!
