One of the recent awesome news for mobile web developer is that &#8220;the browser guy&#8221; Peter-Paul Koch, known as PPK of <a href="http://quirksmode.org";; target="_blank">Quirksmode.org</a> has jumped onto mobile world, backed up by Vodafone. (See his <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/browsers/mobile/" target="_blank">blog</a>). 

I have been working for mobile phones since I joined Nokia in 2005, then Yahoo! later, I have been frustrated with luck of information on mobile browsers. Although Nokia was pioneering sharing information on S60 WebKit browsers, still there was not enough so I had to run many tests by myself without much help from anybody else, and recorded some quirks found a little bit at the time. So PPK&#8217;s work on <a href="http://quirksmode.org/m/table.html" target="_blank">compatibility test table</a> is the one of the best resource I can have! 

Anyway, PPK made his visit to Yahoo! last week and the video of his presentation is now on <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2009/04/27/video-ppk-jsevents/" target="_blank">YUI Theater</a>!
