Earlier this month, I finally attended Edward Tufte's one-day course on **Presenting Data and Information**, where I learned fundamental design strategies for information displays including sentences, tables, diagrams, maps, charts, images, video, and data visualizations.

My actual live-notes were several more pages, but I summarized them nicer after the class:

## Notes from the Class

- Data paragraph
- Evidence and conclusion
- 6 fundamental principle of analytical design
- Presenting Data
