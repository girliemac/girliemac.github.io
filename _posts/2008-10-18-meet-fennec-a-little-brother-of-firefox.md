Here comes Fennec!!! (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/fennec/1.0a1/releasenotes/" target="_blank">Release note</a>)  
  
It&#8217;s been a whole year since Firefox [first announced][1] that they were developing for their mobile version, after the not-so-successful Minimo for WinMo, and they finally released this public alpha for Nokia N810, whose default built-in browser is already Mozilla-based MicroB.  
  
Unfortunately neither I or my beloved DeviceAnywhere has N810 device, so I tried the one for Mac OS.  
Because this is for N810 WVGA screen, so the browser window is set 800&#215;480 pixel, and support touch screen (so you need flick the screen to navigate). I am wondering how comfortable with the UI on other smaller screen devices, or how non-touch screen UI would look like. (Or are they even planning to support one?)   
  
Anyway, I was playing around and tested some pages quickly:

(left) Startup screen, and (right) Yahoo! search.

(L) My twitter home page. Editting was a bit pain because I don&#8217;t see a cursor on this emulator. (R) Run Acid3 test. 90/100 is good (better than iPhone Safari but doesn&#8217;t beat the latest Webkit which gets perfect score).

(L) iCuteOverload. Looks like it supports iUI nicely. I need to take out the &#8220;-webkit&#8221; prefix to see if border-image works on Fennec. (R) Some tests on event &#8211; not seems to support (both results &#8220;true&#8221; on iPhone Safari)  
  
  
Anyway, overall I think this is pretty sweet. I am excite to see the battle among Webkit &#8211; Apple vs. Google, and vs. Mozilla.Also, if you are lucky enough own N810, try <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/mozilla-fennec.install" target="_blank">install</a> it on your device!
