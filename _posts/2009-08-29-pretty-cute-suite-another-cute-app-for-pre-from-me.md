Can&#8217;t have enough cute!  
Instead of upgrading my previous app, iCuteOverload for Palm, I have created this power-up version of cute app called, PREtty Cute Suite. 

This app is more offensively and obnoxiously cute with more cute-related rss feed and flickr pics.  
Included feeds are:

1.  Cute Overload
2.  I Can Has Cheezburger
3.  Cute Obssesion
4.  Epicute
5.  Super Cute Kawaii
6.  Cupcakes Take Tha Cake

Also, a bunch of cute picture streams from Flickr.  
  
  
This app allows you to save the pix/feeds you like as your favorites, also share the links via email.

Currently available as a &#8220;Homebew&#8221; app on <a href="http://www.precentral.net/homebrew-apps/pretty-cute-suite" target="_blank">PreCentral.net</a> for free.  
I have no plan to submit this to the Palm official app store in this moment, at least for this version 0.9.
