OMG, I was live on [**The New Screen Savers Show** hosted by Leo Leporte](https://twit.tv/shows/new-screen-savers) last Saturday! 
If you have watched this show in 90s - the early 2000s, this name must give you such a nostalgic feeling. The show is actually a revival of [The Screen Savers Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screen_Savers)!

Watch me interview by TechCrunch's Sarah Lane on the recorded video on [**TWiT TV**](https://twit.tv/shows/new-screen-savers/episodes/19)!

You may know that I made to the top page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (and a bunch of other media) years ago with **HTTP Status Cats** (Now with the API at [http.cat](http://http.cat), thanks to [Rog√©rio Vicente](https://twitter.com/rogeriopvl)), and recently, I made to the top page of Hacker News again with **KittyCam**, a Raspberry Pi camera with cat facial detection!

The source code and the instruction of KittyCam is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/girliemac/RPi-KittyCam), and I am planning to write a step-by-step tutorial sometimes soon!
