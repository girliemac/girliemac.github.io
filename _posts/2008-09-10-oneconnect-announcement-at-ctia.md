My big boss, Marco took to the keynote stage at CTIA at Moscone West today, to announce a few things including **Blueprint**Â update and (insert drum roll here) **oneConnect** iPhone application.

Yes, Yahoo&#8217;s iPhone app is finally out and available at [iPhone App store ][2]now! Congrats iPhone app team! Go home and sleep!!!

Also, those who attended CTIA, hope you guys didn&#8217;t miss Roger Craig and Dana Stubblefield at Yahoo! booth.
