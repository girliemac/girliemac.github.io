Although I am a "STEM all the way" person (I studied microbiology and worked as a software engineer), I consider myself more a creative side and I am a visual learner -- When I learn new things, I tend to doodle rather than writing everything down. Even when I was studying math and logics, I drew everything to understand the concepts.

Time has passed by and I stopped taking notes with doodles as much as I used to be, until one day I met amazing ladies like [Chiuki](https://twitter.com/chiuki) and [Corey](https://twitter.com/corey_latislaw) who were sketchnoting at tech conferences, and here I am, so inspired and started doodling again.

After several attempts and tweets at Google I/O, I started wanting to make *my own notes* into something more visually appealing and presentable so that I can share my notes with everybody else who want to learn the same subjects.

Now I created the git doodles. With cats.
I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac/status/905270297128865792), and my notifications exploded.

Here's the series of my doodles. Enjoy!


## git purr (git pull)

## git cherry-pick & git log
Now I "handwrite" the doodle digitally with Procreate on iPad!
