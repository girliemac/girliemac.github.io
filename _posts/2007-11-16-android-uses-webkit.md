I somehow thought Google will partner with Firefox as a defaul browser for their new mobile project (now &#8220;Android&#8221;), however, Google&#8217;s choice was WebKit, accordeing to their <a href="http://code.google.com/android/" target="_blank">SDK</a>. Actually now I think this is a wise choice, since many (mobile) web devs are familiar with developing with WebKit thanks to Apple to make iPhone popular. And needless to say, WebKit for mobile including Nokia N-series is the one of the beat browser around.Anyway, as the storonger-than-ever WebKit is gaining even more power, &#8220;<a href="http://webkit.org/blog/122/webkit-3-10-new-things/" target="_blank">Sarfin&#8217; Safari</a>&#8221; (Webkit.org&#8217;s blog) has announced new features for Safari 3:

1.  Enhanced Rich Text Editing

3.  Faster Page Loading
4.  SVG
5.  XPath
6.  New and Improved XML Technologies

8.  Advanced CSS Styling
