As a front-end web developer, also a mobile-web developer, the Palm&#8217;s new WebOS SDK for Pre sounds very attractive, and I could not wait to create some applications although I am still a iPhone user and haven&#8217;t been convinced to switch a service provider.

Then I felt like, I already got this web app, iCuteoverload for iPhone but yeah why not for Pre? So I decide to re-create the same app from scratch. Sure, the existing app is a web app that wrote with JavaScript framework iUI and PHP, does run fine on Pre&#8217;s web browser since Pre is based on Webkit browser. However, I wanted to make this app a standalone client with Mojo framework so I needed to code from scratch.

Anyway, here it is, iCO for Palm is <a href="http://www.precentral.net/homebrew-apps/icuteoverload-palm" target="_blank">now available at PreCentral</a>. The official store is not yet open, so the installing the app may require a bit of geeky skills, but if you happen to be a Pre user and would like to try, follow this tutorial on <a href="http://discussion.treocentral.com/homebrew-apps/194832-webos-quick-install-v1-0-a.html" target="_blank">how to install homebrew apps on Pre for Mac users</a> (And this is for <a href="http://www.precentral.net/how-to-install-homebrew-apps" target="_blank">Windows users instruction</a>). 

By the way, I keep this app name begins with *i*, because I already have named so for iPhone and wanted to keep it for consistency. However, in Pre community, this seems to be a pretty bad thing to do. People see me as a clueless Apple fan <img src='http://girliemac.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' />
