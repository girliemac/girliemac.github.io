<img src="/assets/images/wp-content/misc/tokidoki_yahoo_sandy.png" alt="Tokidoki for Y!" align="right" /> Yay! As a part of &#8220;Start Wearing Purple&#8221; campaign, [Simone Legno][1] has designed the purple Sandy T-shirt for Yahoo! (Yep. Just as most of other Y! tees, this is made by sweat-shop-free American apparel.) 

As you can guess by my style, I am actually a fan of the designer and both my Mac and iPhone have Tokidoki wallpapers. (So some guys working for this campaign had tipped off to me about this T-shirt before the launch.)

Also in this [campaign movie][2], he expresses his purple passion!
