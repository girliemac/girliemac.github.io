<p class="entry">
  I have lost all the past blog entries&#8230;
</p>

The web hosting company went out of business, and left all customers including me without any notice.

I didnâ€™t even backup anything from MySQL.

All the blog entries you see before this post has been added retrospectively by scrapping some cached content from Yahoo and Google search results. (Nothing was found on Web Archive).

Also, I'd like to say thank you for you who have left feedbacks for my lost posts. I am pretty upset for losing all the comments :-(
