<a href="http://www.webcredible.co.uk" target="_blank">WebCredible</a> has this great article about usability on mobile web, *<a href="http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/web-usability/mobile-guidelines.shtml" target="_blank">7 usability guidelines for websites on mobile devices</a>*. With actual examples and screenshots, pros and cons of each are explained nicely and clearly.

The seven guidelines are:

1.  Meet user&#8217;s needs quickly
2.  Don&#8217;t repeat the navigation on the every page
3.  Clearly distinguish selected items
4.  Make user input as easy as possible
5.  Only show essential information
6.  Place basic browsing control
7.  Design mobile-friendly layouts

Do they seem to be common-sense to you?  
Yeah, but trust me, creating mobile web pages following the guidelines is not as easy as it appears to be. Mobile web is *not* just a dumb-down version of its desktop web sites, as some of you may think. Mobile web has whole new purposes!

By the way, I am glad to see Yahoo!&#8217;s <a href="http://m.yahoo.com" title="Go to m.yahoo.com on your mobile device!" target="_blank"><em>oneSearch</em></a> is used as an example for the &#8220;meet users&#8217; needs&#8221;. We&#8217;re working really hard to provide the best mobile experiences to you!!!
