Apple&#8217;s official <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone Dev Center</a> page is updated, and there&#8217;s a link for the newly announced  
<a target="_blank" href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/">SDK</a>. Time to learn Cocoa? 

Actually, I wonder how long it takes to over-number Symbian S60 apps.
