I wrote this article, <a href="https://developer.palm.com/content/resources/develop/creating_usable_ui_buttons_and_interactive_dialogs.html" target="_blank">Creating Usable UIâ€”Buttons and Interactive Dialogs</a>, for Palm webOS Developer Portal. I walk through the Enyo button setup, the proper use of color and text, and how best to use buttons in intuitive, consistent user dialogs.

This is written for the webOS&#8217;s very own enyo.js framework, however, the major contents should apply to any web and app development so please take a look!

Thanks!

p.s. In case you don&#8217;t know &#8211; I am a developer relations engineer at Palm (acquired by Hewlett-Packard). As you may know, the best-yet-most-unfortunated mobile-platform, webOS&#8217;s future is unknown in this moment&#8230;
