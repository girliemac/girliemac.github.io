It was great to be invited to speak at <a href="http://cascadesf.com/3197-2/" target="_blank">Innovators of the Web Conference</a> at Adobe San Francisco on July 21.  
My talk was about strategies on mobile with HTML5 &#8211; Adaptive approach (&#8220;Responsive Web Design&#8221;) and Mobile-only approach.

<a href="http://girliemac.github.com/presentation-slides/cascade/#1" title="presentation" target="_blank">The slides for my preso is available on github</a>. Use arrow keys or spacebar to navigate the slides. (This is created on Google&#8217;s HTML slide template, and it is best viewed on Webkit-based browsers.)

I will blog about some of the contents here or Nokia blog soon! (Yes, I went back to Nokia a few months ago, in case you didn&#8217;t know!)
