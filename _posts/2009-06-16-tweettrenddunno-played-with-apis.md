I had a plenty of time to stay home and play with code right now so I mashed Twitter trend API, mixed with some BOSS news and image search stuff I used before, also Microsoft&#8217;s new Bing search results to create some silly and handy web app called [TweetTrendDunno][2].

Basically, this grabs Twitter &#8220;trending topic&#8221; terms, and as a user click on each term you want to know about, it displays news articles, images, and Bing results (usually summary from Wikipedia helps you to figure out what the term means in general).

If you are Twitter user and ever wonder what people are talking about, give [TweetTrendDunno][2] a try!
