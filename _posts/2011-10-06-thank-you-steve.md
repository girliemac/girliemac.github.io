This is my arbitrary writing about myself & Mac. 

As a die-hard Apple Fan-girl, I started my very first web site in 1996, when people were speculating Apple was going out of business.

At that time, the Mac community was small but very supportive and exciting &#8211; I was particularly involved in the Mac desktop customization email lists, including Japanese ones where I helped fellow designers and developers with translation.  
The Mac-user group in Northridge (maybe it was in Reseda) had a wonderful crowd, and I remember that everybody tried to help me out when my Performa died after installing OS 8. 

When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, we, the community was truly delighted. We all believed that Apple would revive and become bigger than ever.

In 1998, the Bondi-blue iMac debuted with the catch-phrase &#8220;Say Hello to iMac&#8221;. Our minds were blown away. Steve totally did think differently! 

Around the time, Mac OS X came out and I decided to do more &#8220;pro things&#8221; (LOL) on my Mac &#8211; I started studying computer science. 

The funny thing was that a professor at my first comp sci class was also a die-hard Mac fan so I learned I could program in Java on Mac, although if I remember correctly, CodeWarrior for Mac wasn't so up-to-date. I still remember his joke about our computer lab, which was entirely donated by Bill Gates, who used to study at the school.

Years past, my web site has been transformed from Mac-fan site into a web & tech blog, I decided to keep the name GirlieMac! to carry my own legacy, because without Macs, I would never decided to become a web developer.

Thank you, Steve, and good bye.
