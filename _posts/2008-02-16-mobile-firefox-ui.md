I just noticed the 2nd proposal for Mobile Firefox UI was posted, (dated Feb.8).

This screenshot is for touch-screens, by looking at its dimension (240Ã—320), it is almost obviously made for iPhone.

Buttons are overlaid at bottom and by tapping it activates URL bars and more options, including refresh and bookmark.

Personally, I think they need to redo the icon designs. This can look much nicer.
