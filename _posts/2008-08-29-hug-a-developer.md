I hear ya. I feel the pain. Really.

In my case, I was working crazy for CES (deadline = Jan. 7, 08) since around Thanksgiving.  
I had no single day off from the time project started. No Thanksgiving, Christmas or New year.  
On Dec. 27, I was told to start over the entire code because the architecture needed to be completely re-written. I lost my sanity.  
(Even after CES, I was still working on weekends for more trade shows&#8230; I didn&#8217;t even had a chance to visit any of the fun shows. What kind of a sweat shop I am working at?)
