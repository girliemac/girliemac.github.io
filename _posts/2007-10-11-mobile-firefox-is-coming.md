Now Mozilla announced Firefox for mobile devices (and death to Minimo). Yay!!! Big yay from me. They have been hiring mobile engineers so I kinda expected.

Although they haven&#8217;t announced the supported devices/platforms yet, for the obvious reason, I assume Firefox won&#8217;t be available for iPhone and probably be available for Nokia phones since Mozilla is already on N800.

I am hoping to have some good extensions like Fire Bug for mobile web dev!
