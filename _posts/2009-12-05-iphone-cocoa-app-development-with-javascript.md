Hello, I have neglected my blog since September although there have been some blog-worthy events like <a href="http://tnkgrl.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/nokia-n900-meetup/" targtet="_blank">N900 meetup</a> (plus Droid experience and new Fennec demo. See the videos by Tnkgrl from the link!), California Data Camp, release of <a href="http://www.net2streams.net/" target="_blank">Net2Streams Pro</a> (the streaming radio app for Palm WebOS I helped writing) etc&#8230; Well, I keep microblogging on Twitter almost daily basis so <a href="http://twitter.com/girlie_mac" target="_blank">follow me</a> if you&#8217;d like!

One of the interesting I have been independently doing is that writing an app for iPhone with JavaScript, and this time, not an web app but a &#8220;native&#8221; Cocoa app. Yes I said a native iPhone app in JavaScript! But how? -I used this excellent open-source platform, called **Titanium** by <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/" target="_blank">Appcelerator</a>! Without bothering Obj.C or Java, Titanium allows developers to write iPhone and Android apps with the familiar web technology.</>

So, as a test run, I have created the iCuteoverload app for iPhone again. (Originally, I made the web app for iPhone, using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/" target="_blank">iUI</a> in 2007)  
I will not release this app on AppStore -not because of the technical issue but the agreement with the business decision. (Yes, this app contents are not mine and copyrighted!) But I should be able to show the video capture as a demo to tell you what Titanium can do for web devs like me!
