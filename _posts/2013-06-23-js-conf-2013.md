I don&#8217;t usually consider myself as a jetsetter, however, the past months of May and June had been crazy &#8211; I went to Amsterdam (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/girliemac/sets/72157634276296080/" title="Flickr" target="_blank">my Flickr photos</a>) for <a href="http://mobilism.nl/2013" target="_blank">Mobilism</a>, Amelia Island (North part of Florida) for <a href="http://2013.jsconf.us/" target="_blank">JS Conf</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/girliemac/sets/72157634277192086/" target="_blank">Flicker</a>), then Tokyo for a few events (I will write up soon).

At the JS Conf, I managed myself to get a speaking slot for the track B, and had a chance to speak about HTML5&#8242;s JavaScript APIs to access hardware on (mostly on) mobile.  
But I felt like I should&#8217;ve talked more obscured APIs (the ones being proposed and not yet standardized) too, and better demo since the audiences at JS Conf were elite hackers and seem to already know everything I&#8217;ve mentioned.  
You know, the chance was super high at JS Conf, when you randomly stand next to somebody and drink beer with, and they are well-known node.js rockstars or authors of some JS frameworks you&#8217;ve used.
