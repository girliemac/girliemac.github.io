I was excited when **Raspberry Pi 3** came out earlier this year. According to [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/), this 3rd generation Pi has faster CPU, WiFi, and Bluetooth 41. and BLE, additional to the previous model.

So I decided to upgrade [KittyCam](http://www.girliemac.com/blog/2015/12/25/kittycam-raspberrypi-camera-cat-face-recog-nodejs/), a cat camera app built with my Raspberry Pi + Node.js project, which and I blogged about a while ago.

At that time, I was using the older Node v0.12.x (pre-IO.js, which I almost forgot about it happened after merged back with Node.js), so I decided to upgrade everything.

## Install the Latest Raspbian

Since I got a brand-new Pi3, I install everything fresh, so instead of swapping the SD card from the old Pi, I installed the latest Raspbian build.

Forst, I download the latest **Raspbian Jesse** from [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) to my Mac, then install it in a micro SD card using these [instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) using `dd` tool.

In case you are also a MacBook Air user and don't know, your MacBook has a SD card slot on the right hand side. But you will need an adapter.

## Installing Node 4

Last time with Node 0.12, I used the 3rd party [node-arm](http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/) to install it, but now ARM version is officially supported on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

So you can just open up a browser in Raspbian, and download from [nodejs.org Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

Scroll the page down to **Additional Platforms** and choose ARMv7 (Note: I think ARMv8 works too, but I installed v7).

![node download](/assets/images/articles/2016/06/raspi3-node4-armv7.png)

or download and install on terminal as I did:

```bash
$ wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.4.5/node-v4.4.5-linux-armv7l.tar.xz
$ tar -xvf node-v4.4.5-linux-armv7l.tar.xz 
$ cd node-v4.4.5-linux-armv7l
$ sudo cp -R * /usr/local/
```

Check if Node is successfully installed by checking its version:

```bash
$ node -v
```

If you wish, upgrade **npm** to v3 too.

```bash
$ npm install -g npm3
```



## Installing Updated Dependencies for KittyCam

Create a `KittyCam` directory and copy everything except `package.json`from [KittyCam repo](https://github.com/girliemac/RPi-KittyCam). But also keep the `node_modules/kittydar` because installing kittydar using npm, and use it as is will fail, when you install Node-Canvas. (or tweak kittydar's `package.json` manually!)

### Installing Cairo

Get **Cairo** on your Raspbian bore installing Node-Canvas:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev build-essential g++
```

Once set up with Cairo, in KittyCam dir,

```bash
$ npm install canvas
```

### Installing Johnny-Five

Also, since the last time I created KittyCam, [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) and the IO-plugin for Raspberry Pi, [Raspi-io](https://github.com/bryan-m-hughes/raspi-io) have been upgraded a lot too. So just install the latest manually:

```bash
$ npm install johnny-five --save
```

```bash
$ npm install raspi-io --save
```

### Installing All other Node Modules

and all other node modules used for KittyCam. In the app, I am also using Cloudinary and PubNub. You can install both with npm too.



## Hardware Wiring

I have not updated any hardware besides Pi.

When you hook up with a camera, make sure to enable the camera module from the **Pi Software Config Tool**.

```bash
$ sudo raspi-config
```



Now, everything should work with Raspberry Pi 3!

I had chance to test it out while I was taking care of my friends' cats!

I have given the talk about KittyCam in a few conferences and meetups so far, such as NodePDX in Portland and ForwardJS in San Francisco. My slide deck is available on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/tomomi/nodepdx-from-software-to-hardware-how-do-i-track-my-cat-with-javascript)!
