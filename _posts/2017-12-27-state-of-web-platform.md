In October, I attended the annual Chrome Dev Summit, which I never missed since the first one.

I was mostly just listening the talks at the conference, but did make this note form the keynote, "The state of Chrome and the Web Platform" by my former-boss at Palm webOS DevRel, [Dion Almaer](https://twitter.com/dalmaer) and [Ben Galbraith](https://twitter.com/bgalbs)!
