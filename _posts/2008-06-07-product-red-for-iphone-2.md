![iPhone 2][1]  
  
OK, I&#8217;ve got my (RED) iPod, and now Apple is going ship it for the next-gen iPhone?

Although not sure about the credibility, according to the leaked photos posted on <a href="http://mobilecrunch.com/2008/06/06/photos-of-the-iphone-2-leaked/" target="_blank">MobileCrunch</a>, the iPhone 2 is 22% thinner than the current iPhone and comes with a front-facing camera for video-chat.

The color variations include black and red. Do I need to wait for iPhone 3 for pink??? (besides ordering a custom-made from <a href="http://www.colorwarepc.com/p-103-iphone.aspx" target="_blank">ColorWare</a>).
