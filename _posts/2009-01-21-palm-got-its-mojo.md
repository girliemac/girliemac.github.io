Happy new year, and happy new government, America!  
I am still recovering from flu I got while visiting freezing New York City, and finally feel like blogging again.

The first topic I write in this year, besides Whitehouse 2.0 and Steve Jobs&#8217; health is a whole new Palm. 

<img src="/assets/images/wp-content/misc/Palm_webOS_Launcher.png" align="right" />I know it is not a new news anymore, but I was shocked when they announced <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/index.html" target="_blank">Palm Pre</a> at CES (although I have not been there since nobody sends some lowly engineers to Vegas). Honestly, after Blackberry then iPhone, I though there&#8217;s no way Palm can win the market again, so it is shocking to see their stock price rising after the announcement.

As a web developer, great news for me is that Palm will switch their web browser engine to Webkit. Since 200 when Palm acquired Handspring, their standard web browser was Blazer, running on Palm OS.  
Now Palm OS has become legacy and, will have a completely new OS, called &#8220;WebOS&#8221;. which is based on Linux.

Palm webOS applications are easy to write using Mojo &#8211; a new application framework based on the HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript  
Yesh! HTML5! &#8211; means you can even use offline database!  
Also, reportedly Adobe is working on a Flash plug-in for the webOS browser.

Interestingly, Ajaxian has reported that Dojo is used as a base for Mojo.  
The Mojo Framework source code can be found on <a href="http://www.palm.com/assets/js/dist/mojo.js" target="_blank">Palm&#8217;s site</a>.

The official Palm Mojo SDK is not available yet, but stay tuned by following the developer&#8217;s <a href="http://pdnblog.palm.com" target="_blank">blog</a>.

Additionally, unlike iPhone, which uses Samsung&#8217;s <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/productInfo.do?fmly_id=229&#038;partnum=S3C6400" target="_blank">S3C6400</a> processor, Pre even has wicked fast processor, <a href="http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/wtbu/wtbuproductcontent.tsp?templateId=6123&#038;navigationId=12796&#038;contentId=36505&#038;DCMP=omap&#038;HQS=ProductBulletin+OT+omap3440" target="_blank">TI OMAP 3440</a>, which embeds Imagination Technologies&#8217; POWERVR SGX graphics core, suitable for advanced multimedia.
