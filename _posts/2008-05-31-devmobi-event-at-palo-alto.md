Today, I had a chance to attend <a href="http://dev.mobi/" target="_blank">dev.mobi</a> developers&#8217; session at Palo Alto. 

I am actually a user of their web tools and documentations, and really like the way they are trying to set standard for developers. 

In today&#8217;s session, I was able to find out more about their ongoing projects. Paul Nerger of <a href="http://mtld.mobi/" target="_blank">dotMobi</a>, explained the interesting new product from them is called <a href="http://deviceatlas.com/" target="_blank">Device Atlas</a>. This is a comprehensive database of mobile device information, such as hardware info, OS, browser. supported graphic format etc., with easy-to-follow GUI. The first version was just released a few months ago and they are now working on new features such as integrations with <a href="http://ready.mobi" target="_blank">Ready.mobi</a> test suite, W3C checker Firefox plugin, providing analytics and competitive benchmarking. 

One of the biggest pain for me to work on mobile web is a cross-browser issue. Surely there&#8217;re thousands of mobile devices means thousands of different browsers. I already appreciate for the OMA and WURFL for the data, so with more partners like Nokia, Vodafone, Volantis etc. Device Atlas seems to be so promising fore more accurate info.The data is available as json files. So for example, to get the screen resolution of a certain device, get the UA and simply call its json data. 

By the way, just like me, Paul doesn&#8217;t like the term &#8220;WAP&#8221;. I do use the term to distinguish it from desktop web, but I always felt some sort of awkwardness to say it. Yeah, WAP rhymes with crap, right Paul!
