![Dior phones][1]

There were <a href="http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2005/05/donatella_versa.html" target="_blank">Versace by Nokia</a>, <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=151" target="_blank">Dolce & Gabbana by Motorola</a>, <a href="http://www.lge.com/products/model/detail/ke850.jhtml" target="_blank">Prada by LG</a> etc. And now Dior will have its own luxury mobile phone, manufactured by ModeLabs of France, with the high price-tag of $5000! This is like a Vertu price, sans the concierge service&#8230;

The Dior phones won&#8217;t be available in the US, or even Europe &#8211; available only in China and Russia.
