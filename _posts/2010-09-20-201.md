I haven&#8217;t got a chance to create the apps and demos I&#8217;ve been thinking because my day job at Palm has kept me really busy. (Yeah, we&#8217;re shipping webOS 2.0 pretty soon!)  
So instead of writing a new material, I decided to post the stuff I was testing around a while ago because SVG seems to be a hot topic since the HTML5 buzz!

<img src="/assets/images/wp-content/misc/svg-mask.png" align="right" />This is an example of CSS mask with SVG. -The CSS alpha mask is introduced by <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/181/css-masks/" target="_blank">Webkit.org</a> back in 2008.

And this image at the right is a screen capture from WebKit Nightly browser. The photo I use here is a Twitter avatar photo of <a href="http://twitter.com/SOCKINGTON" target="_blank">@sockington</a>, masked with an [SVG file][1] (I used the vector image created by <a href="http://eagl0r.deviantart.com/#/d2yth6g" target="_blank">eagl0r</a> on DeviantArt and converted it as as SVG with Adobe Illustrator) with using Webkit-only CSS 3 property, <code style="font-weight:bold">-webkit-mask</code>. 

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1330446/demo/mask.html" target="_blank">The actual demo is here.</a>  
This works only on advanced webkit-browsers with SVG support, such as Safari 4+ and Chrome 2+ (not sure. I need to check). Android webkit browsers currently do not support SVG.  
For non-supporting browsers, you should just see three rectangle pictures as fallback. Nothing should look broken. 

### The code is Simple

```html
<img class="avatar" src="avatar-pic.png">
```

```css
.avatar {
  -webkit-mask-box-image: url(twitter-bird.svg);
}
```

I used `mask-box-image` instead of `mask-image` to make the mask stretch to fit with various image sizes and aspect ratio. `mask-image` repeats the mask images as patterns (also you can specify the type of repeat, and position etc. I am not going to talk about them here but you can read on the reference link below).
