I have been really busy, in an awesome way-

I have been working on a project called Coremob Camera, as a side project for <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/coremob/" target="_blank">W3C Core Mobile Web Platform CG</a> (I will write more about the project later), and spoke about the project as *Mobile Web: Real Life Examples of HTML5 for Mobile* at <a href="http://www.w3.org/conf/2013sf/" target="_blank">W3Conf</a> on Feb 22nd, then flew very next day to Barcelona for <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/" target="_blank">Mobile World Congress</a> to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/MWC/" target="_blank">join W3C</a> to demo the Camera App.

Coming back home, and had another talk on HTML5 Mobile Approaches at <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ci87mj5k218hh7md4h617q37848" target="_blank">Google DevFest</a> Googleplex in Mountain View on March 15th, then I had done the HTML5 Use-Cases talk again at <a href="http://html5devconf.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Dev Conf</a> in San Francisco. Each event gave me an amazing experience.

Anyway, if you would like to see my slide decks, the interactive HTML-version (the ones I actually used for the presentations) are available on <a href="https://github.com/girliemac/presentation-slides" target="_blank">github pages</a> and the embeddable version and the PDFs are on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/girlie_mac" target="_blank">speakerdeck</a>.

I will give the updated talk on the open-sourced camera app at an event in Tokyo in June (TBD), and O'Reilly <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/" target="_blank">OSCON</a> in Portland, OR on July 26th!
