Since I started talking about hardware hacking with JavaScript at events and conferences, I have been constantly asked by fellow JavaScript engineers where to get started.

It is easy once you know how, but starting something new is always difficult, or more like, you won't even want to try unless somebody shows you how. So I decided to create a video series to walk through.

Especially because I already have written some tutorials and published as my day job, including ["How to Create a Smart Device With Arduino and Node.js Using PubNub"](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-smart-device-with-arduino-and-nodejs-using-pubnub--cms-25508), I wanted to film the video version. Although there was some conflicts with marketing team at work (I will talk about it sometimes…), I secretly did this side project with help pf my colleague, Eric, and made two videos.

Eventually, it was picked up by [Arduino.cc ](https://arduino.cc) blog, so we have proven that creating contents that target indie devs aren't bad idea at all. It is rather sad when people think supporting "hobbyists" is wasting company money and resources.

Anyway, this is Part Uno of my video tutorial, where you can learn how to use Johnny-Five with Arduino, also learn about the basics of wiring and how to blink an LED in 10 minutes!
