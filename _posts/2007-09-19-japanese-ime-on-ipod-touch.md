Apple have posted an [iPod Touch features guide][1] a few days ago, and I finally had a chance to read it.

As I wrote and posted photos regarding iPhone&#8217;s Asian language supports, I was wondering about future multi-language support on iPhone, but now I know that iPod Touch will feature Japanese IME before iPhone does!

According to the manual, iPod touch provides keyboards in 14 different languages, and supports the following keyboard formats:

*   QWERTY
*   QWERTZ
*   AZERTY
*   QZERTY
*   Japanese IME

And now, curious enough, I obtained these visual evidences:

1.  [Twitter message][2] by Toshiyuki Masui, an engineer behind the Japanese IME. (Fact: Sony Ericsson&#8217;s Japanese input system called POBox, had been developed by his team).
2.  Unofficial photos
