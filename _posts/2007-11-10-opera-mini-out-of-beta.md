Looks like <a href="http://operamini.com" title="Opera Mini 4" target="_blank">Opera Mini 4</a> is now official. I just updated Opera Mini on N95 and played around.

Although I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any new features added from Beta 4, the nice new features added for 4 (compared to 3) includes &#8220;mini&#8221; version of the entire web page, just like Nokia&#8217;s WebKit, and landscape mode.

The page rendering speed seems to be just as fast as I expected &#8211; faster than WebKit.

As long as I&#8217;ve been testing on the beta and now this official 4, as a web developer, I am happy with the improvement on CSS support. So many pages that looked like crap on Opera 3, are now beautifully rendered. It supports better table layout and more semantic markups (Now, I can use the strong, H1 tags etc. without making terrible mess) and CSS3 including media queries. Although limited, it supportes some JavaScript events as well.

Also, Opera launched a developers&#8217; community site called <a href="http://dev.opera.com" title="Dev Opera" target="_blank">Dev Opera</a> recently, to help us developing better on Opera.
