Note: I originally wrote this article for [PubNub Blog][pubnubBlog], but I am re-posting it with a bit more personal touches here at girliemac.com.

Well, first of all, I left Nokia for the second time. It has been interesting two years at Nokia Sunnyvale office. One of the best accomplishments there is becoming an open web advocate and worked with W3C while I was there.


Now, I joined a San Francisco startup, called [PubNub][pubnub], which provides data streaming network. This is quite a change for my career because I have been exclusively working for mobile space, and this is the first time working outside of the industory since 2005.
Playing with data is fun, and I thought using the data with *Internet of Things (IoT)* may be more fun, too. Well, I am not really hardware savvy, so I will need to learn more about it.

Yep, I am still a mobile geek, and an open web advocate at heart, naturally my first project at PubNub was about HTML5 web app (that of course supports touch events!). So here's the digest version of my article. [For full article, please read it on PubNub][pubnubBlog]!


![Screencast](/assets/images/articles/2014/09/doodle-realtime.gif "CoDoodler Screencast")

This screencast is an actual screencast that I took while some total strangers on the InterWeb were doodling. Just about the time my free version of RecordIt terminated recording, the last person started drwaing "Teh Boobs" *[sic] on purpose, supposedly!*

OK, so this tutorial shows you how to create a very simple doodling web app that allows multiple users draw on the canvas at the same time, using PubNub realtime JavaScript API.

Try this [demo][demo] first, and continue reading the article and view the [entire source code][code] on github and the [simplified code][simple] on Codepen to follow the basic tutorial to fork and tweak by yourself.


## Creating Basic Interactive Drawing with Canvas

Let's create a drawing canvas.

```
<canvas id="drawCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
```

```html
var canvas = document.getElementById('drawCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

Now, take a user input to make the canvas drawable. This is how it works-

Free-drawing action is initiated when a user clicked on the canvas. A line is drawn dynamically as long as the user is holding the mouse down, and ends when it is released.

Let's create some functions, which should be called upon the mouse events on canvas. The events to be observed are `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup`:

```javascript
canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', startDraw, false);
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw, false);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', endDraw, false);
```
To include touch and pointer events support for touch-screen devices, read my old article, [Touchy-Feely with DOM Events: Rethinking Cross-Device User Interaction][touch].


Now, you are going to write a *draw* function, which traces the mouse path by collecting the canvas coordinates into an array, then starts drawing the path on canvas with `beginPath()` method, connect each coordinate with `lineTo()`, and `stroke()` to complete drawing the path, while a flag, `isActive` is set `true`. 


```javascript
// create a flag
var isActive = false;

// array to collect coordinates
var plots = [];

function draw(e) {
  if(!isActive) return;

  // cross-browser canvas coordinates
  var x = e.offsetX || e.layerX - canvas.offsetLeft;
  var y = e.offsetY || e.layerY - canvas.offsetTop;
 
  plots.push({x: x, y: y});
  
  drawOnCanvas(plots);
  
}
```

Connecting all the (x, y) coordinates and draw a line by using canvas methods.

```javascript
function drawOnCanvas(color, plots) {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(plots[0].x, plots[0].y);
 
  for(var i=1; i<plots.length; i++) {
    ctx.lineTo(plots[i].x, plots[i].y);
  }
  ctx.stroke();
}
```

Write other two functions to toggle the flag. Also empty the array after each line is drawn.

```javascript
function startDraw(e) {
  isActive = true;
}
	
function endDraw(e) {
  isActive = false;
  
  // empty the array
  plots = [];
} 
```

Yay, you just have create a very simple drawing web app! Go on to the next step to make it even more interactive.

## Making It Collaborative with Multiple Users

Here's the fun part- you are going to make it as a multi-user app.

This is where you are going to use [PubNub][pubnub] APIs. You don't need to learn anything special here as long as you're comfortable with JavaScript. Not even WebSocket knowledge, or node.js.

OK, so you can make it collabolative by *publishing* and *subscribing* the drawing path to data stream. Get your [PubNub API keys][admin] ready, if you don't have one yet, [sign up][signup] to get your own unique keys.

When you are ready, include the JavaScript libraries in your HTML to begin.

```html
 <script src="http://cdn.pubnub.com/pubnub.min.js"></script>
```

Initialize the API.


```javascript
var channel = 'my-draw-demo';
 
var pubnub = PUBNUB.init({
	publish_key: 'your-publish-key',
	subscribe_key: 'your-subscribe-key'
});
```

### Publish and Subscribe

In the last step, you have created an array that hold all canvas coordinates. In this step, you are going to send one user's drawing path data to PubNub network, also receive path data from other users.

![Publish and Subscribe](http://girliemac.com/assets/images/articles/2014/09/publish-subscribe.png "PubNub Data Stream")


To send data, all you have to do is broadcast the array to the channel with one of the data stream APIs, `publish()`. Simply add these lines of code in your `endDraw()` function, just before emptying array. 

```javascript
pubnub.publish({
    channel: channel,
    message: { 
    	plots: plots // your array goes here
    } 
});
```

To retrieve the published data, you simply need `subscribe()`.

```javascript
pubnub.subscribe({
	channel: channel,
  	callback: drawFromStream
});
```
Once you successfully retrieve the data object from the stream, call the callback function to draw lines from the received array data on canvas, just like you did in the last step.

```javascript
function drawFromStream(message) {
  	if(!message) return;		
  	
  	ctx.beginPath();
  	drawOnCanvas(message.plots);
}
```


Ta-da, you just have create a very simple multi-user canvas app!
