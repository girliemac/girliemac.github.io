I came back from Japan last week and finally I am recovered from jet lag.

Anyway, today, I will hear more details on gPhone announcement later, but I post this pink &#8220;yPhone&#8221; pic I took during my stay in Japan.

<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2350/1867231050_97da4998df_m.jpg" style="padding-right: 10px" alt="yPhone?" title="yPhone?" align="left" height="240" hspace="10" width="180" />

Unfortunatelly, this is not a gPhone-competitor or anything sexy that excites the US mobile usersâ€¦ actually, this is my friend&#8217;s phone by Softbank*, equipped with &#8220;Y!&#8221; button to launch Yahoo! Japan apps.

*Notes: Softbank Corp. owns Vodafone Japan, also its subsidaries includes Yahoo!
