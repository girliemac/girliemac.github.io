Finally, I have my app, called [iCanHasLOL published on App Store][1]!  
Actually the app was reviewed within 24 hours by Apple, although I&#8217;ve heard it would usually take 2 weeks. 

I mentioned that I had been writing an iPhone app using Appcelerator before, and an app was almost ready to go. However, I was not able to publish it with the particular contents so I re-wrote the app and re-created some graphics to finish up this brand-new app.

This is free of charge also ad-free (for now, at least!) so [get your copy][1] now!
