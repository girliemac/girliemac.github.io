A year ago, [I joined Microsoft](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac/status/1280180665367982080) and it has been an interesting ride so far, despite the fact that I joined during the pademic. (Leaving the previous workplace, Slack without going to office was interesting in a different way though...)

Although my main focus is supporting Microsoft 365 developer products, I have gotten chances to work on numerous projects outside of the immediate team, including open technologies, education, localization, etc. to keep myself involved in something I have been always working on for my entire tech career, and not tied to the Microsoft proprietary technologies.

## Doodling for scientists

One of my re-discovered passion is doodling, especially something technical, which I had neglected for a long time in my tech career. 

My past life was a researcher at am environmental microbiology research lab a long time ago, and my lab had a lot of my doodles on the wall. These were the lab protocols and the doodles included a lot of Erlenmeyer flasks, tubes, Petri dishes, and stuff.

I remember people kept telling me how the visual reference helped them. 

## Doodles to help educating developers

And now I think this can be totally applied for this different type of science— computer science and programming, and my new teammates in Microsoft agree.

In fact, Microsoft advocacy team fully enbraces the way to support developers with visual helps and already have amazing sketchnote and technical illustration artists who are actually software engineers and program managers, including [Nitya Narasimhan](https://twitter.com/sketchthedocs), [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper), [Dasani Madipalli](https://twitter.com/dasani_decoded), and [Wassim Chegham](https://twitter.com/manekinekko).

Recently, we have released a few open-source beginner-focused curriculums on GitHub, including [Web Dev for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners) and [ML for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners), and I worked on sketchnote-style summaries for some lessons.

Here are some of my setchnotes—

*Web Dev 101 - Intro programming*

*Machine Learning - Regressions*

The curriculums are under MIT license and the content including my sketchnotes are under Creative Commons. The printable versions are [available as TIFF format](https://github.com/girliemac/a-picture-is-worth-a-1000-words) too.
