So, this is what has been keeping me busy (not blogging) these days. Announcing HP TouchPad! 
I have been working as a part of the development team for the secret weapon, which was just announced at the HP&#8217;s press event at Fort Mason, San Francisco on Feb. 9th, for a while (especially hardware development take a lot longer than software!). Literally, my heart was beating during the live demo but when the crowd applauded, I felt great and so relieved. 

At the evening&#8217;s developer event after the press event, we have announced the new and better JavaScript framework, Enyo. I probably write up something on HP/Palm&#8217;s developer blog later (yes, the site still has the Palm brand!), so stay tuned if you&#8217;re interested developing for webOS!
