Since the last CES announcement, I have been pretty excited to learn about Palm&#8217;s WebOS, been to the meetup and DevCamp, and have created 2 homebrews and co-wrote Net2Streams app.

Now I have joined the human interface team at Palm, inc. It&#8217;s awesome I can work with a shiny new toys (Pre and Pixi), also I am happy to keep working on WebKit!  
(Plus, it&#8217;s cool I constantly bump into my ex-colleagues and friends from Yahoo! in the area!)
