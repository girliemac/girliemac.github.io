I forgot to post the slides from my talk at <a href="http://html5devconf.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Dev Conf</a> in San Francisco on October 15 and 16. 

There were so many great speakers and varieties of topics all day long for two days, and I truly enjoyed being there as an audience and as a speaker.  
And I would like to say thank you so much for all of you who attended at my talk. I was surprised to see the room was completely full -actually it was overflowed so some had to sit on floor, and some turned away by staff.

Anyway, my talk was about strategies on mobile with HTML5 â€“ pretty much same as the last talk at Innovators of The Web Conf, but with more updated info and demos.

<a href="http://girliemac.github.com/presentation-slides/SFHTML5DevConf/" target="_blank">The slides for my preso is available on github</a>. Use arrow keys or spacebar to navigate the slides. (This is created on Google&#8217;s HTML slide template, and it is best viewed on Webkit-based browsers.)
