![Lolcat on Y!Go][1]  
  
Last time I made CuteOverload into Apple iPhone WebApp, &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/entertainment/icuteoverload.html" target-"_blank">iCuteOverload</a>&#8220;, so this time I made I Can Has Cheesburger? into <a href="http://mobile.yahoo.com" target-"_blank">Yahoo!Go</a> mobile widget.

Try it on Yahoo! Go client, or open up an web browser in your mobile device and go to http://beta.m.yahoo.com, login, go to &#8220;widget&#8221; by clicking the icon looks like a tool on top and add &#8220;I Can Has Cheezburger?&#8221;. Works on iPhone at the URL too!
