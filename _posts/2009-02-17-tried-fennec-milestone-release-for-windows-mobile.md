Last week, Mozilla has released the early version of Firefox Mobile, &#8220;Fennec&#8221; for Windows Mobile (pre-alpha).  
Just like the earlier release was only for VGA Nokia devices like N800, this WinMo-release targets only one device, HTC Touch Pro.

Unfortunately I could not borrow an actual HTC &#8220;Fuze&#8221; (AT&#038;T version of Touch Pro), so I tested via DeviceAnywhere service. 

Just typed in the Mozilla&#8217;s ftp address directly on PIE (I have no reasons why I didn&#8217;t use the default Opera Mobile), downloading and installing was fine (Pic.1).  
I got a pretty Fennec icon on screen. Nice. But I hope Mozilla will make it less jaggy for the next release. (Pic.2)  
Clicked the icon and wait, wait, wait&#8230; pretty slow. When I almost lost my patience, the browser finally launched&#8230; its title bar. Let&#8217;s wait for more. -nothing happened.  
Quit and relaunched. &#8211; the same result.  
Re-installed. &#8211; the same result. (Pic.3)
