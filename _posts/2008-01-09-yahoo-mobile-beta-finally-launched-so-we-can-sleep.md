We finally launched Yahoo! Mobile Web beta (http://beta.m.yahoo.com) for limited high-end devices including iPhone, Nokia N-Series, also Windows Mobile incl. Moto Q, Palm Treo this morning.

Next project &#8211; launching for more devices, and intâ€™l support for<a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/" target="_blank"> 3GSM</a>. Nearly all engineers gave up Vegas&#8230; so can we go to Barcelona next month instead? Pretty please por favor?
