I had this wonderful opportunity to speak at <a href="http://openwebcamp.org/" target="_blank">OpenWebCamp III</a> at Stanford University on this weekend, and I feel very honor to be there with so many great speakers and attendees. 

Apparently, I have been doing mobile development longer than most of people, I picked the subject on developing mobile web, and how it has been changed and what we can do next.

I covered the topics including:

*   How the mobile development has changed from WML, XHTML-MP, HTML4 and finally HTML5 with CSS3 
*   Legacy to HTML5: using input attributes to make easier for a user to type on phone 
*   Dealing with smarter phones: Viewport and Media-queries 
*   High DPI display: CSS pixel != Device pixel 
*   Device API </ul>
