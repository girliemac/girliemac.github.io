The original GirlieMac! site started in 1996 and was devoted for total Mac desktop customization for girls. 
I have created varieties of cute little desktop icons, wallpapers, <a href="http://www.kaleidoscope.net/schemes/" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope schemes</a>, fonts etc. all available for download for free.

### Icons

### Font

### Download

If you would like to download them, they are still available at my server so [go grab them][4]! 

  


As the time passed by, I stopped creating such goodies and GirlieMac! site has lost its meaning&#8230; more time has passed, I found myself becoming a mobile web developer. So I took this opportunity when Apple has announced iPhone, and decided to revive this site with a new blog but kept the domain name.
