I have been fortunated enough to be invited to speak at conferences and tech events in and out of San Francisco Bay Area.

I have most of my presentation slides hosted here on Github, also, PDF-converted slides and hosted on SpeakerDeck.

A lot of people have asked me what framework I use for my slides. The answer is that I use [Shower][shower] HTML Presentation Engine. It comes with print CSS so you can convert the HTML slides into PDF easily too. I totally recommend if you would like to create your interactive slides in HTML too.
